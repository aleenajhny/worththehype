# WorthTheHype 🎯

WorthTheHype is a credibility-first, city-based restaurant discovery platform built for Kochi, Kerala.

Instead of showing what’s popular, it compares online hype with real user experience and surfaces the gap — called the **Delta**.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- **Hype Score** – Online buzz  
- **Reality Score** – First-hand community reviews  
- **Delta** – Difference between perception and reality  

**Positive delta** → Worth visiting  
**Negative delta** → Likely overhyped  

---

## 🧠 AI 

- Evaluates review text for specificity and tone  
- Tags reviews as **Likely Genuine** or **Low Confidence**  
- Generates a neutral community summary per restaurant  
- AI never removes reviews — it only affects influence

## Project Description

WorthTheHype is a city-based restaurant discovery platform that compares online hype with real user experiences. It helps users identify whether a restaurant is genuinely worth visiting or simply overhyped.

---

## The Problem Statement

Food discovery platforms often prioritize popularity and promotions, leading users to visit overhyped restaurants with poor real-world experiences. Fake reviews, bots, and promotional content further reduce trust in existing systems.

---

## The Solution

WorthTheHype introduces a credibility-first approach by separating hype from reality. It uses community-driven reviews, visible account credibility, and AI-assisted review analysis to surface honest dining experiences instead of promotional noise.
